This is a little snake browser game, quite simple and basic code.
The js code is taken from a lection with Generation, i've just done some adjustments for the various gamemodes like collisions and gamespeed.
I've added the "play again" feature and "mode selector" also for having better features, otherwise you would start each gamemode via VSCode and eachtime you'd lose the game would quite instantly restart
and with the nightmare mode it's quite confusing.
